# LightLattices.jl
The package allows one to create regular lattices with arbitrary unit cells. For the exported types of unit cells and lattices, it defines the array interface which allows to access the coordinate of specific node by its index. In addition to that, it provides a function `relative_coordinate` whih allows to calculate the shortest vector connecting two nodes.
